Mastery Project 2:
# MS-NYC-Rental-Analysis

Overview

In this project, we are going to analyze the short-term rentals data in New York City for the startup Pillow Palooza. In addition, we will provide recommendations to the company's stakeholders so they can optimize their strategy of maximizing revenue and occupancy rates.

Datasets

Data are collected from both internal and public sources on rental listings in New York City

GloBox stores its data in a database with three main tables: Users (user demographic data): id, country, gender. Groups (user A/B test group assignment): uid, group, join_dt, device. Activity (user purchase activity): uid, dt, device, spent.

The task at hand is to analyze the results of the A/B test and provide a recommendation to the stakeholders about whether GloBox should launch the experience to all users.
